description: "Night and Day is a novel by Virginia Woolf first published on 20 October\
  \ 1919. Set in Edwardian London, Night and Day contrasts the daily lives and romantic\
  \ attachments of two acquaintances, Katharine Hilbery and Mary Datchet. The novel\
  \ examines the relationships between love, marriage, happiness, and success.\nDialogue\
  \ and descriptions of thought and actions are used in equal amount, unlike in Woolf's\
  \ later book, To the Lighthouse. There are four major characters, Katharine Hilbery,\
  \ Mary Datchet, Ralph Denham, and William Rodney. Night and Day deals with issues\
  \ concerning women's suffrage, if love and marriage can coexist, and if marriage\
  \ is necessary for happiness. Motifs throughout the book includes the stars and\
  \ sky, the River Thames, and walks. Also, Woolf makes many references to the works\
  \ of William Shakespeare, especially As You Like It.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
